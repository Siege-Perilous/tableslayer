## Image Flow Specification

### Overview

The application uses three different image types for scenes:

1. **mapLocation** - Raw uploaded image stored on R2

   - Used as source for Stage display (via R2 3000px width thumbnail)
   - Updated when user uploads new map image

2. **mapThumbLocation** - Rendered Stage thumbnail stored on R2

   - Generated by `generateThumbnail()` on save
   - Contains all Stage post-processing (crops, fog, grid, etc.)
   - Used in SceneSelector list (via R2 400px width thumbnail)

3. **R2 Processed Thumbnails** - Auto-generated versions
   - 3000px width version of mapLocation ‚Üí Stage display
   - 400px width version of mapThumbLocation ‚Üí SceneSelector display

### Expected Flow

1. **Initial Map Upload**:

   - User uploads image ‚Üí stored as `mapLocation`
   - R2 generates 3000px thumb ‚Üí displayed in Stage
   - On save: `generateThumbnail()` creates `mapThumbLocation`
   - R2 generates 400px thumb of mapThumbLocation ‚Üí displayed in SceneSelector

2. **Map Image Change** (via SceneSelector or MapControls):

   - New image ‚Üí updates `mapLocation`
   - R2 generates new 3000px thumb ‚Üí updates Stage
   - On save: `generateThumbnail()` creates new `mapThumbLocation`
   - R2 generates new 400px thumb ‚Üí updates SceneSelector

3. **Stage Edits** (fog, grid, crops, etc.):
   - Changes applied to Stage display
   - On save: `generateThumbnail()` creates new `mapThumbLocation`
   - SceneSelector updates with new rendered thumbnail

### Key Points

- `generateThumbnail()` should ONLY run on save operations
- `mapThumbLocation` represents the "rendered" state of the Stage
- SceneSelector should always display `mapThumbLocation` (not `mapLocation`)
- All thumbnails should refresh immediately after save via Y.js sync

### Important Behavioral Requirements

1. **Asynchronous Thumbnail Generation**:

   - Map changes should update immediately in Stage (via mapLocation)
   - Thumbnail generation happens asynchronously on save (can lag behind)
   - SceneSelector updates when mapThumbLocation is ready (no flash required)

2. **Non-Selected Scene Map Changes**:

   - When changing map of non-selected scene via SceneSelector menu:
     - Only `mapLocation` updates (no Stage to render from)
     - `mapThumbLocation` remains unchanged
     - To update thumbnail: user must select scene + trigger save

3. **Selected Scene Flow**:
   - Map change ‚Üí Stage displays new map immediately
   - All editors sync new mapLocation via websockets
   - On save ‚Üí generateThumbnail() runs ‚Üí uploads mapThumbLocation
   - SceneSelector updates with new rendered thumbnail when ready

## Phase 6: Legacy Cleanup (Commit 6) - üìã PLANNED

**Goal**: Remove old websocket utilities and simplify components

### Image Loading Improvements

**Problem**: Client-side image loading causes flashing due to cache-busting timestamps

**Proposed Solution**:

- Use unique filenames for images instead of overwriting with scene IDs
  - Example: `map/[uuid].jpg` instead of `map/[sceneId].jpg`
  - Example: `thumbnail/[uuid].jpg` instead of `thumbnail/[sceneId].jpg`
- This eliminates the need for cache-busting timestamps (`?t=...`)
- Browser can properly cache images since URLs don't change
- Only load new images when the actual image changes

**Benefits**:

- No flashing when switching between scenes
- Better browser caching
- Cleaner URLs
- More reliable image loading

### Implementation

1. **Remove legacy websocket code**

   - Old `broadcastStageUpdate` functions
   - Manual `socketUpdate()` calls
   - `propertyUpdateBroadcaster` utility
   - Complex throttling logic
   - Any remaining socket.io references

2. **Component simplification**

   - Remove `bind:stageProps` throughout
   - Clean up manual `$effect` usage
   - Simplify component props
   - Remove unused websocket utilities

3. **Type definition cleanup**

   - Update component prop types
   - Remove obsolete interfaces
   - Clean import statements

4. **Final optimization**
   - Remove dead code
   - Consolidate Y.js patterns
   - Performance verification

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] All functionality preserved
- [ ] Cleaner, more maintainable code
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] All edge cases handled

### Success Criteria

- Significant code reduction
- Cleaner architecture
- Better developer experience
- All features working as before

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Approach

- **Complete socket.io replacement** in Phase 1
- **Prove Y.js WebSocket works** before proceeding
- **Git reset** if Y.js doesn't work reliably
- **No parallel systems** - cleaner implementation

### Rollback Strategy

- Each phase commits independently
- Git reset if Y.js proves problematic in Phase 1
- Thorough testing at each phase before proceeding
- Feature flags only within phases, not between systems

### Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Socket.IO + Y.js integration** (not direct replacement)
2. **y-socket.io provider** for seamless server communication
3. **UUID-based marker IDs** (no temp ID complexity)
4. **Centralized update functions** instead of bind patterns
5. **60 FPS global throttling** with slider exceptions
6. **Focus-based save coordination** for conflict prevention
