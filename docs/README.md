This folder contains documentation for various architecture patterns in Table Slayer. Typically these get added after a large PR for complex systems. Although I check them for readability, their primary function is to provide LLM context to the codebase.

## Documents

- **debugging-guide.md** - General debugging tips and strategies
- **grid-system-architecture.md** - How the grid system works
- **stage-performance-guide.md** - Performance patterns, GPU memory management, and optimization techniques for the Stage component
- **yjs-sync-architecture.md** - Real-time sync architecture using Yjs
