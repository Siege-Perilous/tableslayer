You can now draw small notes or illustrations on top of maps within the Table Slayer editor. These notes can live on separate layers, each with a distinct layer and opacity. [#307](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/307)

#### Fixes

- Improved the save system where rapid movements in the fog and drawing tools would cause old versions of the drawing to resurface. [#313](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/313)
- Markers will now counter-rotate against the scene rotation to make sure that the text is always "right side up". [#315](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/315)
