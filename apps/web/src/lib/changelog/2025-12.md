Table Slayer now provides a radial menu on the playfield for limited scene interaction. If your TV supports capacitive touch, this menu can be invoked with a two finger long press, otherwise a right mouse click will work. The new menu contains a simplified collection of the editor tools for measurement, fog, drawing and scene changes. Any changes you make will be synced to any open editors you might have on another device (like a connected laptop or iPad). [#366](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/366)
