Table Slayer's drawing tools now let you add magic and environmental effects to your maps. This is useful for tracking spell effects like grease, water, ice or fire. If you dare, you can even tear open the fabric of space and time! Effects smartly order based on their type, so normal annotations will still sit above the fog layer when needed.

#### Fixes

- The drawing outline now shows more reliably. Markers now show above any effect drawings. [#386](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/386)
- Performance improved. Users can now hit `F9` to show render statistics with an FPS counter. [#385](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/385)
- Fixed keyboard shortcuts and scene control menus to better react to toggles. Also fixed shortcut conflicts between the drawing layers and map zoom. [#382](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/382)
- Fixed scene thumbnails sometimes being applied to the wrong scene when switching scenes during a save operation. [#377](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/377)
