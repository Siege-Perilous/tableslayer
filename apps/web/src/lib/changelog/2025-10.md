The interface for the drawing and fog erase tools were improved to better support touch devices. The sliders for size, color and opacity have taken inspiration from tools like Procreate to make them a little easier to adjust with fat fingers. Similarly, the layer selector now shows preview thumbnails for each drawing layer.

#### Fixes

- Added persistence to marker tooltips. They'll now recover when you return to your scene or refresh the page. [#354](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/354)
- Fixed issues of "rubber banding" when panning or zooming maps. [#355](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/355)
- Various dependencies for self-hosting were made optional. You no longer need Resend, Google, or Stripe API keys to self-host. [#352](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/352)
