#### Fixes

- Fixed issues where scene switching could cause infinite loops [#360](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/360)
- Fixed map autofitting for scenes without grid dimensions. Maps uploaded without grid units in the filename now properly fit within scene bounds and automatically rotate to landscape orientation when appropriate. [#363](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/363)
- Fixed the map fit button to correctly fit maps within scene bounds instead of filling (which could crop the map). [#363](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/363)
