Previously Table Slayer would not update if you had the same editor open in two places. This could be across two tabs or browsers open in separate computers. This was a bit dangerous because it allowed a stale editor to overwrite the content of a more current one. Now, Table Slayer performs actions similar to tools like Figma, which will handle live conflict resolution between editors and make sure they all stay in sync.

#### The active scene is now at the Party level

Game sessions are easy way to store related scenes in a group. Previously Table Slayer would make your table's playfield URL at this session level. This was problematic whenever you wanted to change the scene on your table if it was across two (or more) game sessions.

Table Slayer now has one play URL at the party level, and you can only have one active scene across all your game sessions. [#301](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/301)
