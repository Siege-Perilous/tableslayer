Markers can now conditionally show tooltips on the playfield if they aren't set to "DM only". Additionally there is now a third type of tooltip: "Reveal on Hover", that allows you to show a marker and its tooltip when you hover over it in the editor. These new tools allow you to quickly create signposts for points of interest in large maps.

The shared play field can how have a different fog opacity than the one used for the Editor. This makes is easy to hide features with fog to players, but still retain the ability to view those features in your editor. [#336](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/336)

Table Slayer now supports the ability to use movie files (MP4, webm) or GIF files as your source map. All effects, like color grading and weather, will work alongside these new animated maps. [#318](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/318)

#### Small features

- Added a product changelog to track features. [#333](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/333)
- Added a promo system to provide free lifetime keys as giveaways. [#331](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/331)

#### Fixes

- The popover in the Text Editor now positions correctly on mobile devices. [#335](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/335)
- The cursor system now renders directly in the play field, rather than being calculated with complicated math, significantly improving performance. [#336](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/336)
- Fog and drawing masks are now saved as [RLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) encodes in the database rather than PNGs uploaded to the CDN. This vastly improves drawing performance. [#339](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/339)
