#### Automatically align maps to grid

Table Slayer now provides easy ways to align and build grids for maps that have a known size (ex: `farmhouse_30x22.png`). Now when you upload a map with this file pattern it will automatically set the new `Grid mode` setting to `Map defined` and automatically build the grid, scaling the map to fit. You can also toggle and define these settings manually in the grid controls popover.

Because the available grid space is limited by a TV's physical size, large maps might bleed past the edges. When in this new mode, you can use `Shift + arrow keys` to pan the map in grid-sized increments as you need.

#### Marker tooltips

Markers can now conditionally show tooltips on the playfield if they aren't set to "DM only". Additionally there is now a third type of tooltip: "Reveal on Hover", that allows you to show a marker and its tooltip when you hover over it in the editor. These new tools allow you to quickly create signposts for points of interest in large maps.

#### Set fog opacity unique to player or DM view

The shared play field can how have a different fog opacity than the one used for the Editor. This makes is easy to hide features with fog to players, but still retain the ability to view those features in your editor. [#336](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/336)

Table Slayer now supports the ability to use movie files (MP4, webm) or GIF files as your source map. All effects, like color grading and weather, will work alongside these new animated maps. [#318](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/318)

#### Small features

- Added a product changelog to track features. [#333](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/333)
- Added a promo system to provide free lifetime keys as giveaways. [#331](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/331)

#### Fixes

- The popover in the Text Editor now positions correctly on mobile devices. [#335](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/335)
- The cursor system now renders directly in the play field, rather than being calculated with complicated math, significantly improving performance. [#336](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/336)
- Fog and drawing masks are now saved as [RLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) encodes in the database rather than PNGs uploaded to the CDN. This vastly improves drawing performance. [#339](https://github.com/Siege-Perilous/tableslayer/pull/339)
