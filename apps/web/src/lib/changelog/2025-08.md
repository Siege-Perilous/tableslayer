Table Slayer now allows you to make measurements relative to your grid. There are tools for point-to-point lines, cones, squares and circles. When using square grids these will measure in typical Dungeons and Dragons / Pathfinder distances, where the diagonal counts for 10ft every other square. Hex measurement works as well, but these measure it raw units (1 hex, 2 hexes... etc).
